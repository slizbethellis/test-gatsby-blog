# Test Gatsby Blog

This repo contains my work in progress on building a blog with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/). Blog post search uses [gatsby-plugin-local-search](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-local-search/) with the FlexSearch engine, and the search modal is a homage to the styling of the Algolia modals. Stateful components rely on [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), and styling is with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution. This repo is intended solely to showcase the design and coding work I have done in building my website for my craft presence. The main codebase for my full website is in a private GitLab repo.
