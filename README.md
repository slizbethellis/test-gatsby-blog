# Test Gatsby Blog

This repo contains my work in progress on building a blog with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution. This repo is intended solely to showcase the design and coding work I have done in building my website for my craft presence. The code for the final version of my blog will be stored in a private GitLab repo.

## Things left to do:
* create a separate page for the blog posts with sidebar
* make a pattern page that either pulls patterns from Ravelry's API or add a category in the CMS
* remove products page once pattern page is ready
* add RSS feed
* add blog post search
* add comments to blog posts
* make a working carousel for the home page (stretch goal)
