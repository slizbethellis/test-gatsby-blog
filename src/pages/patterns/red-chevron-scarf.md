This scarf pattern was written for the sake of the [Red Scarf Project](https://www.fc2success.org/programsmentoring-and-support/red-scarf-project/). Just a good basic, unisex scarf pattern suitable for charity knitting or gift giving. Okay, it's more of a recipe than a pattern.

Gauge is not importantâ€¦just knit on needles of an appropriate size for the yarn of your choice. This pattern is easily adapted for other weights of yarn.
