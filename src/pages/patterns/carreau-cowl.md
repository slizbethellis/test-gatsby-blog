Sometimes you need some instant gratification from your knitting. Whether you’re a novice seeking a quick introduction to mosaic colorwork, or an expert seeking a break from your latest cobweb lace project, it’s hard to say no to a quickie project in super bulky. The mosaic stitches keep the knitting just engaging enough, yet don’t slow down the knitting too much…part of the fun of thick yarn is the speed after all!

The smaller cowl uses two contrasting colors of the same yarn. And if you use the suggested yarn for the smaller cowl, there will be enough left over to make a second cowl with reversed colors, or a coordinating slouchy sideways beanie. The larger cowl was designed to show off a gradient skein, and the contrast is a simple solid to ensure the gradient yarn is the star.

’Carreau’ is French for ‘tile’ or ‘square’, and it also rhymes with ‘chapeau’, which is their word for hat.
