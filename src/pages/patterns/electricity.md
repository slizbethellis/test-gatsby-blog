Spiraling jogless jogs…they’re never quite as invisible as proponents of the technique claim they are. And then you have to figure out how to shoehorn that traveling beginning of the round into a pattern that doesn’t spiral. (Yes, there are other non-traveling methods, but those are specific to horizontal stripes, and not particularly relevant to most stranded colorwork.)

My goal was to make a piece that incorporates the jogless jog in a more humane manner. The colorwork pattern for this hat was created by taking basic stranded blocks and staggering the pattern one stitch left every round. The jog always falls at the boundary between motifs, which provides some camouflage, or at least makes the jog look like more of a deliberate design detail.

The motifs forming lightening bolts instead of slanting blocks was a happy accident. I staggered the crown decreases because I didn’t want obvious decrease lines or interruptions in patterning.

1x1 corrugated ribbing above the rolled edge helps keep the hat secure, and also has the advantage of having more memory than the more common 2x2 corrugated rib. Use a springy wool like either of the yarns featured here, and your hat will stretch to fit almost any adult head. And what better way to finish a pointy crown than with a giant, fluffy, multicolored pom pom?
