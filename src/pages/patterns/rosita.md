Anyone who knows me well could tell you that I’m a huge Missoni fan. My obsession started when I was a child and constantly pored over my mother’s collection of knitting magazines.

The idea for this shawl came to me when I was browsing designer knitwear collections for inspiration, and saw a M Missoni sweater with wavy stripes. I thought that the stitch had to be a closed version of feather and fan, but decided to take a look at the other photos of the sweater anyway. Upon inspection of a close-up detail shot, I realized that the stitch pattern was more akin to that of the iconic Cookie A. sock pattern, Monkey, albeit stretched much wider. So this shawl pattern is a loving tribute to both Missoni and the Monkey socks. The name of this pattern is a nod to the matriarch of the Missoni clan.

This top-down shawl uses two ends of the same ball of self-striping lace yarn to break up the natural striping sequence of the yarn into a different striping pattern. Or you could try two different colors if your choice of self-striping yarn isn’t as high of contrast as the yarns used here.

There are a total of eight edging charts to allow for making this shawl a custom size, but the Knitty pattern only includes two of the charts (for the sizes photographed), since the charts for this pattern are massive.
