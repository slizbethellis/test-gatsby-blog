description: >-
  Faroese shawl shaping is a simple, but elegant solution to the age-old problem
  of keeping a shawl on your shoulders. But why limit this shaping to lace
  patterning? (No insult intended to lace knitters…I’m a lace fanatic too, but I
  need variety.) Colorwork also looks great in a Faroese shape.


  This shawl is a top-down Faroese-style with mosaic colorwork worked with two
  colors. I chose single-ply yarns for this project, because I love the look of
  singles in elongated stitches. The beginning tab is worked in stripes to
  better match the rest of the selvedge. Increases are worked on the wrong side
  and twisted to resemble make ones on the right side, which allows for keeping
  the stitches in pattern all the way to the selvedge.


  The edging is a few rows of garter mosaic so the edging blends in nicely with
  the main pattern, and the bind-off is worked with both yarns for a braided
  look.


  ‘Alfarería’ is the Spanish word for pottery. Well, one of them anyway. There’s
  also ‘cerámica’, but that term more specifically refers to ceramics. The
  geometric forms of mosaic knitting make me think of ornamentation on pottery.
