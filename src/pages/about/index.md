My first knitting lesson was just before I turned ten, and I’ve scarcely spent a day without knitting since then. Although I learned the most basic of basics from my mother (casting on and off, knit/purl, possibly basic decreases), most of what I know came from reading a book or article and experimenting on my own. I also happen to be a decent crocheter (I think my first lesson was roughly a year after I learned to knit), but I’m definitely nowhere near as skilled at crochet as I am with knitting. My first published design, (warning: the following two links go to Ravelry) the [Awry Hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/awry-hat) [and Mitts](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/awry-mitts), appeared in [*Knitscene*, Accessories 2015](https://www.interweave.com/product/knitscene-accessories-2015-digital-edition/). I have also had six patterns featured so far in *Knitty*, the latest of which is [Frühlingsblümchen](https://knitty.com/ISSUEss24/PATTfruhling/PATTfruhling.php).

My mission is to create patterns that will inspire you to try new techniques and experiment with yarn and color selection. But most of all, I want my designs to be fun to make and wear.

As for other interests, I'm trained in full stack development, specifically the MERN stack. I also collect music in physical formats, although I do not have my turntable set up at the moment (lack speakers, and my current dac/headphone amp has no analog inputs). As for TV, I'm very much into sci-fi and British comedies. I aspire to be a polyglot, and I've been brushing up on my German and Spanish skills with Duolingo, along with starting on Japanese (I know it's not the best way to start on Japanese, but I am making progress).

## What'd you use to build this website?
This website is built in Gatsby, which is a static site generator using React.js. Yes, that's right, this blog is React-based and uses GraphQL to grab data. Is this the first knitting blog built in React? Possibly. I'm using Netlify for CDN and deployment of this site, and the CMS is now Decap CMS. I'm using Tailwind CSS for the styling, and Headless UI for stateful components.
